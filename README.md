### Holdem Poker Exercise

This is a Rust based exercise to get some hands on experience with three main concepts:
 - Implementing traits
 - Working with enums and matches
 - Using the iterators

#### What's the goal?

Under `src/poker.rs` you will find some structures and tests that start to describe a game of Texas Holdem Poker. 

The game *IS NOT* intended to be complete (and it may not even be good Rust), in fact, it really only deals with some early elements of a game like players, cards and dealing an opening hand. Don't even trip.

In the same file you will find a set of tests that won't compile, you'll probably want to comment them out and work through them one by one.

#### Anything else?

There's loads of room for extra work here, in fact I have a bunch of types that I thought would be interesting but didn't get round to using.

Good luck
